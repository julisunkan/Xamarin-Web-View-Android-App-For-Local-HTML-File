# About
A Xamarin WebView Android App To View Local HTML File.
WebView App is a native Android application which uses web view component for displaying content. With this template you can turn your responsive website into a universal mobile app. It is quick, easy and affordable. WebView App has many useful built-in features and services.

This template provides you easy way to make your own app. It does not require extreme programming skills. Code is easily configurable and customizable. There is just one config file to setting up everything. Project is well documented. Create your own app in less than 15 minutes without any special knowledge! It’s easier than you think.

WebView App uses powerful & fast Chromium engine. It is compatible with WordPress or any other web framework. It supports HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap and other web technologies.

I have a lot of experience with developing Android apps. My priority is to create top quality products with beautiful design, write a perfectly clean code and make apps easily configurable and customizable. We are following Android Design Guidelines and permanently watching new trends.
